=======================================

This is the first release of Programmers Notepad 2. Obviously there are a limited number of features at the moment.

Please don't moan about the following, they are all quite obvious to us already:

4) No project management.
5) No tools.
6) No printing.
7) Toolbars aren't dockable.
8) You can't turn the tabs off.

So what is good?

1) New editing engine (The excellent Scintilla: http://www.scintilla.org/).
2) Now written in C++ using the Windows Template Library.
3) Fast. Really Fast - compare opening times for large files with PN1.
4) Two (count-em!) toolbars. Obviously this sort of stuff will get better as time goes on.
5) Lovely XP-Style tabs.
6) Save-As dialog contains a "File Format" feature.
7) Support for C++, HTML, XML and Object Pascal. More schemes coming soon.
8) Highly configurable XML backend for scheme configuration, config dialog coming to a release near you soon.
9) The minibar from pn1 is here (see at the bottom of the edit windows).
10) Scoping / Folding / Outlining (Open a C++ or Pascal file to see this, it's lovely).
